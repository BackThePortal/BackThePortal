Hey there, I'm backo!

I'm a highschooler who *accidentally* became a learning programmer.

The project I'm most proud of (which is one of the few that have ever been released) is TheTinMen Posts Classifier. You can find it [here](https://backtheportal.com/thetinmen).

I began programming with Scratch when I was in 7th grade, and completely fell in love with it. A year or so later, I finally started learning actual web development, and have pretty much never stopped since then. I love the concept of frameworks that abstract away repetitive tasks. I always use Vue.

As of October 2023, I am fluent in TypeScript and Python.

This year, I'll be attending a programming olympiad, which is why right now I'm focusing more on C++ and Python programming.

Anyway, have a look at my repos if you'd like, and have a nice day!
